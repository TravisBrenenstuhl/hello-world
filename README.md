# hello-world

A place where I store ideas, resources, share and discuss things with others.

HELLO WORLD! My name is Travis! I live in mid-MO, USA. Grew up in a small town where I seemed to be the only kid in my class that fell into the category of "Computer Nerd". Since highschool I've worked for my family doing general construction: Roofing, Flooring, Electrical, Plumbing...  I'm 25 now and I'm finally realizing that I need to be building a career around my passion for computers/DEV. I'll be focusing on Front-End Web Development. I welcome any and all advice and or encouragement.
